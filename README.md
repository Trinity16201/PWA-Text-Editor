### Description
This application is to be used with or without an internet connection as a text editor application. This progressive web application can also be installed like other applications typically available in the application store.
 
### Additional Credits
Most of the resources used were included in the classwork mini project. I also received assistance from the BCS assistant and reviewed a youtube video for a better understand of PWA.
